# Hcal

Digi emulation, reconstruction, veto, and (some) analysis code for the Hcal subsystem of LDMX.

**Note** This code currently cannot be built independent of [ldmx-sw](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/ldmx-sw).
If you wish to develop a specific branch here, you should clone all of ldmx-sw and then go into this
submodule and checkout your branch from there.
