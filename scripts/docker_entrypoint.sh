# Entry point for the ldmx production container
#   The basic idea is that we want to go into the container,
#   setup the ldmx-sw working environment, and then
#   run the application with any provided arguments.
#
#   We mount and run inside the present working directory.

## Bash environment script for use **within** the docker container
## Assuming the following environment variables are already defined by Dockerfile:
#   XercesC_DIR      - install of xerces-c
#   ONNX_DIR         - install of onnx runtime
#   ROOTSYS          - install of root
#   G4DIR            - install of Geant4

source $ROOTSYS/bin/thisroot.sh
source $G4DIR/bin/geant4.sh

# add ldmx-sw and ldmx-analysis installs to the various paths
export LDMX_SW_INSTALL=/usr/local/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LDMX_SW_INSTALL/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$LDMX_SW_INSTALL/python:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=$LDMX_SW_INSTALL/bin:$PATH

# add externals installed along side ldmx-sw
# TODO this for loop might be very slow... might want to hard-code the externals path
for _external_path in $LDMX_SW_INSTALL/external/*/lib
do
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$_external_path
done

# go to first argument
cd "$1"

# run the rest of the arguments depending on the command
if [[ "$2" =~ .*".py" ]]
then
    # command ends in '.py'
    #   assume that we are running the ldmx application
    fire "${@:2}"
else
    # otherwise just run everything like normal
    eval "${@:2}"
