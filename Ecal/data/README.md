# ECal Data Files
Most of the data files are related to various BDTs
(Boosted Decision Trees) that were used while studying the ECal's
veto performance. Only two of the files have been
copied from the legacy submodule into ldmx-sw v4.

You can still download the legacy data files from
the archived submodule [LDMX-Software/Ecal](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/Ecal).
Putting them in this directory will mean they will
be installed along side the current BDT model (gabrielle)
and the cell locations text file (cellxy).
