     * @brief Emulate the digitization procedure performed by the HGCROC.
     *
     * This object emulates how the chip converts the analog signal
     * into DIGI samples. With that in mind, the digitize method
     * converts a set of voltages and times into the DIGI.
     *
     * This object _does not_ do anything related to subsystem information.
     * It does _not_ set the detector ID for the DIGI it constructs,
     * it does _not_ simulate noise within the empty channels,
     * and it does _not_ convert simulated energy depositions into
     * voltages. These tasks depend on the detector construction,
     * so they are left to the individual subsystem producers.
     *
     * @TODO Shift the pulse SOI arbitrarily
     * @TODO More realistic TOT emulation

             * other than zero. This should shift which sample the peak of
             * the pulse is placed in.
             *
             * #### ADC Mode
             * Here, we measure the height of the pulse once per clock cycle.
             * This leaves us with nADCs_ samples for each digitized hit.
             * The voltage measurements are converted to ADC counts using
             * the parameter gain_.
             *
             * The time of arrival (TOA) is zero unless the amplitude
             * is greater than toaThreshold_. Then the TOA is set to
             * the point the pulse crosses the toaThreshold_ with
             * respect to the current clock window.
             * The time measurements are converted to clock counts
             * using 2^10=1024 and clockCycle_.
             *
             * Both the tot_complete_ and tot_progress_ flags are set
             * to false for all the samples.
             *
             * #### TOT Mode
             * Here, we measure how long the chip is in saturation.
             * This is calculated using the drain rate and assuming
             * a linear drain of the voltage off of the chip.
             *
             * Thus, TOT = pulse peak / drain rate
             * and TOA is calculated as before, seeing when the 
             * pulse crossed the TOA threshold.
             *
             * @TODO What do the ADC measurements look like during the TOT measurment?
             *
             * The TOT is then converted into the samples using the following algorithm.
             *
             *  1. Calculate the number of clock cycles it would take for the TOT to be measured
             *  2. Convert the TOT measurement [ns] to TDC counts using totMax and the internal 12 bits
             *  3. Convert TDC counts (12 bits) to the 10 bit sample using
             *     - if ( TDC > 512 ) ten_bit_sample = TDC
             *     - else ten_bit_sample = 512 + TDC/8
             *  4. Insert the ten_bit_sample into the correct sample using the index above
             *  5. Set the other samples to normal ADC measurements, 
             *     using the flags to show if TOT is in progress or not
             *
             * #### Pulse Measurement
             * All "measurements" of the pulse use the member function measurePulse.
             * This function incorporate the pedestal_ and optionally includes noise
             * according to noiseRMS_.
             *
             * @note For more realism, some chip parameters should change depending on the
             * chip they are coming from. This should be modified here, with a package
             * of "HgcrocConditions" passed to this function to configure the emulator
             * before digitizing.
