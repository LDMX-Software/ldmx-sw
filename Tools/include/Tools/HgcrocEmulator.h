 * @class HgcrocEmulator
 * @brief Emulate the digitization procedure performed by the HGCROC.
 *
 * This object emulates how the chip converts the analog signal
 * into DIGI samples. With that in mind, the digitize method
 * converts a set of voltages and times into the DIGI.
 *
 * This object _does not_ do anything related to subsystem information.
 * It does _not_ set the detector ID for the DIGI it constructs,
 * it does _not_ simulate noise within the empty channels,
 * and it does _not_ convert simulated energy depositions into
 * voltages. These tasks depend on the detector construction,
 * so they are left to the individual subsystem producers.
 *
 * @TODO Shift the pulse SOI arbitrarily (needed for realism stuff below)
 * @TODO more realistic TOT emulation with focus on OOT signals
 * @TODO more realistic ADC emulation with focus on OOT signals
 * @TODO time phase setting relative to target t=0ns

  /**
   * Digitize the signals from the simulated hits
   *
   * This is where the hefty amount of work is done.
   *
   * - Sum the voltages and voltage-weight average the times
   * - Put noise on the time of the hit using timingJitter_
   * - Configure the pulse to have the calculated voltage amplitude as its
   *   peak and the simulated hit time as the time of its peak [ns]
   * - Determine what readout mode the ROC will choose:
   *   - Amplitude < readoutThreshold_ : skip the hit, return false
   *   - Amplitude < totThreshold_ : ADC Mode (described below)
   *   - Amplitude > totThreshold_ : TOT Mode (described below)
   *
   * @TODO Allow for the user to choose a sample of interest (iSOI_)
   * other than zero. This should shift which sample the peak of
   * the pulse is placed in.
   * @TODO To incorporate Out Of Time (OOT) pileup, the SOI should be able
   * to shift to a later (non-zero) index and then the chip would need to
   * be un-able to readout if an earlier hit sets the current SOI to
   * tot_progress_.
   *
   * #### ADC Mode
   * Here, we measure the height of the pulse once per clock cycle.
   * This leaves us with nADCs_ samples for each digitized hit.
   * The voltage measurements are converted to ADC counts using
   * the parameter gain_.
   *
   * The time of arrival (TOA) is zero unless the amplitude
   * is greater than toaThreshold_. Then the TOA is set to
   * the point the pulse crosses the toaThreshold_ with
   * respect to the current clock window.
   * The time measurements are converted to clock counts
   * using 2^10=1024 and clockCycle_.
   *
   * Both the tot_complete_ and tot_progress_ flags are set
   * to false for all the samples.
   *
   * #### TOT Mode
   * Here, we measure how long the chip is in saturation.
   * This is calculated using the drain rate and assuming
   * a linear drain of the voltage off of the chip.
   *
   * Thus, TOT = pulse peak / drain rate
   * and TOA is calculated as before, seeing when the
   * pulse crossed the TOA threshold.
   *
   * @TODO What do the ADC measurements look like during the TOT measurment?
   *
   * The TOT is then converted into the samples using the following algorithm.
   *
   *  1. Calculate the number of clock cycles it would take for the TOT to be
   * measured
   *  2. Convert the TOT measurement [ns] to TDC counts using totMax and the
   * internal 12 bits
   *  3. Insert the TOT measurement in the SOI (setting tot_complete_ flag to
   * true)
   *  4. Set the tot_progress_ flag for any samples after the SOI that are
   * within the number of clock cycles it takes for the chip to recover
   *
   * #### Pulse Measurement
   * All "measurements" of the pulse use the member function measurePulse.
   * This function incorporate the pedestal_ and optionally includes noise
   * according to noiseRMS_.
   *
   * @note For more realism, some chip parameters should change depending on the
   * chip they are coming from. This should be modified here, with a package
   * of "HgcrocConditions" passed to this function to configure the emulator
   * before digitizing.
