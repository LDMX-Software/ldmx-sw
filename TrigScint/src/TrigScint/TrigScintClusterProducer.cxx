        split | seeds        keep | disregard   keep! | just move on
              | next cl.          | (later seed       | (no explicit splitting)
                                  might pick
                                  it up)


    The idea being that while there could be good reasons for an electron to
    touch three pads in a row, there is no good reason for it to cross four.
    This is noise, or, the start of an adjacent cluster. In any case, 4 is not a
    healthy cluster. Proximity to a seed governs which below-seed channels to
    include. By always starting in one end but going back (at most two
    channels), this algo guarantees symmetric treatment on both sides of the
    seed.


    //Procedure: keep going until there is a seed. walk back at most 2 steps
    // add all the hits. clusters of up to 3 is fine.
    // if the cluster is > 3, then we need to do something.
    // if it's == 4, we'd want to split in the middle if there are two potential
    seeds. retain only the first half, cases are (seed = s, n - no/noise)
    // nsns , nssn, snsn, ssnn.  nnss won't happen (max 1 step back from s,
    unless there is nothing in front)
    // all these are ok to split like this bcs even if ssnn--> ss and some small
    nPE is lost, that's probably pretty negligible wrt the centroid position,
    with two seeds in one cluster

    // if it's > 4, cases are
    // nsnsn, nsnss, nssnn, nssns, snsnn, snsns, ssnnn, ssnns.
    // these are also all ok to just truncate after 2. and then the same check
    outlined above will happen to the next chunk.

    // so in short we can
    // 1. seed --> addHit
    // 2. walk back once --> addHit
    // 3. check next: if seed+1 exists && seed +2 exists,
    // 3a. if seed-1 is in already, stop here.
    // 3b. else if seed+3 exists, stop here.
    // 3c. else addHit(seed+1), addHit(seed+2)
    // 4. if seed+1 and !seed+2 --> addHit(seed+1)
    // 5. at this point, if clusterSize is 2 hits and seed+1 didn't exist, we
    can afford to walk back one more step and add whatever junk was there (we
    know it's not a seed)
