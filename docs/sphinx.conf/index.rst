ldmx-sw python configuration module
===================================

This manual is auto-generated from the documentation comments
within the python configuration modules. If there is any confusion,
one is highly encouraged to look directly at the code for these modules
and contribute improvements to the documentation. This manual is hosted
separately from the C++ Manual and the general documentation site so
links going back to those pages are included at the top of each page.
