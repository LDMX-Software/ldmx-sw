    The guns position and momentum are determined by shooting a positron
    _backwards_ from the target without any detector components present. This
    uses Geant4 to calculate the trajectory within the magnetic field for us.
    Since the particle (if its high enough energy) will not interact with anything,
    you only need to generate a few events to get a good measurement.

    Parameters
    ----------
    position: list[float]
        end-point position of the positron shot backwards from target,
        is the start-point of an electron being shot into the target
    momentum: list[float]

        defines the starting direction of an electron being shot into

    energy: float
