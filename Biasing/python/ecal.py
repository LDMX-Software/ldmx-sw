    """Example configuration for producing photo-nuclear reactions in the ECal.  
       
    In this particular example, 4 GeV electrons are fired upstream of the 
    tagger tracker.  The TargetBremFilter filters out all events that don't 
    produced a brem in the target with an energy greater than 2.5 GeV.  The
    brems are allowed to propagate to the ECal at which point they are 
    checked by the EcalProcessFilter.  Only events that see the brem photon
    undergo a photo-nucler reaction in the ECal are kept.

    ----------

    detector : str
