 * @class MidShowerNuclearBkgdFilter
 *
 * The basic premis of this filter is to add up all of the 
 * energy "lost" to the configured process. Whenever a particle
 * makes a step and has secondaries within that step going to
 * the input process, we add its change in energy to the running
 * total for the event. When the PartialEnergySorter has run out
 * of "high" energy particles to process (when NewStage is called)
 * we check if the running total is high enough to keep the event.
 *
 * @see PartialEnergySorter
 * Here we assume that the partial energy sorter is being run in sequence with
 * this filter. 
 *
 * @see WeightByStep
 * Here we do not try to infer the weight. We assume that the action
 * WeightByStep is being run in sequence to calculate the event weight.
