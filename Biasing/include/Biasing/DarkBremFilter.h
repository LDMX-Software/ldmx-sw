     * @class DarkBremFilter
     *
     * This class is meant to filter for events that produce a dark brem matching
     * the input parameters:
     *      volume: A' originates inside of the input volume (target or ecal)
     *      nGensFromPrimary: A' produced by electron removed from primary by <= input n generations
     *
     * The general idea for this filter is to force Geant4 to
     * simulate the tracks in generation order. This is done by
     * pushing all new tracks to the waiting stack and incrementing
     * the current generation by one when the urgent stack is empty.
     * Checking if the A' is produced is done in the PostTrackingAction,
     * and the event is aborted if we reach a generation later than the input
     * generation and no A' has been found.
