# Pre-Release Validation Samples

The configuration scripts in this directory are run by the New Pre-Release workflow.
They are used to generate large samples for humans to investigate manually; therefore,
the configs must take the run number as input.

Each config is named have the sample it generates (e.g. sample `inclusive` is generated by `inclusive.py`),
and the run number is the first (and only) command-line input.

```
ldmx fire inclusive.py <run-number>
```
