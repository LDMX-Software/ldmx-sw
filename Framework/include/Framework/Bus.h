   * A bus passenger

   * We store the bus passenger's baggage as a dynamically created object.

   *
   * Here we do all the heavy lifting of carrying a certain type
   * of object with specializations for clearing, sorting, and printing.
   * @note Printing specialization is possible if we include the requirement
   * that all event objects must define the 'operator<<' method.
   *
   * ## Core Functions
   *  1. Define the type of "baggage" that is being carried on the event bus
   *  2. "Attach" the baggage to a output or input TTree for writing or reading
   *  3. "Update" the contents of the baggage
   *  4. "Clear" the baggage to a default or empty state at the end of each
   * event
   *  5. "Print" the baggage to a ostream (via the operator<<)
   *
   * ## Basic Structure
   *
   * The method of specializing the clear, post_update, and attach methods
   * to the different types of passenger's baggage is derived from
   * <a
   * href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/08/15/function-templates-partial-specialization-cpp/"
   * >a helpful blog post</a>.
   * Basically, the idea is to add a parameter input into
   * the functions that "stores" the type that we are currently carrying. This
   * allows the compiler to choose the best method from the overloaded functions
   * by matching the types of parameters.
   *
   * ## Possible Types
   *  - BSILFD - bool, short, int, long, float, double
   *  - class with Clear() method defined
   *  - std::vector of type with operator< defined
   *  - std::map with key type that has operator< defined
