 * @class RandomNumberSeedService
 * System for consistent seeding of random number generators
 *
 * The system can be configured in a number of different ways.  In general,
 * seeds are constructed based on a master seed.  That master seed can be
 * constructed in a number of ways, chosen in the python configuration. (a) The
 * master seed can be the run number of the first run observed by the service
 * ("Run") (b) The master seed can be based on the current time ("Time") (c) The
 * master seed can be provided in the python configuration ("External")
 *
 * Individual seeds are then constructed using the master seed and a simple hash
 * based on the name of the seed. Seeds can also be specified in the python
 * file, in which case no autoseeding will be performed.
