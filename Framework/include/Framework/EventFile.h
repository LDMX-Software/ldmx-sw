             *
             * This needs to be called *after* setupEvent.
             * This method uses the event to help drop collections.
             *
             * The rules should be of the following form:
             *      <drop,keep, or ignore> exp
             *      where exp is an expression that matches the collectionName.
             *      ignore ==> any branch with name matching exp is not even read in from the input file (if it exists)
             *      keep   ==> any branch with name matching exp is read in from the input (if exists) and written to output (if exists)
             *      drop   ==> any branch with name matching exp is read in from the input (if exists) and NOT written to output
             *
             * The default behavior for all branches is keep.
             *
             * ROOT uses the internal TRegexp to match branch names to the passed
             * expression and set the status of the branch (whether it will be read or not).
             * This internal object has different rules than real regular expressions, 
             * so it is best to keep it safe and only use asterisks or full names.
             * Additionally, the rules you pass are analyzed in succession, so you can go from something more general
             * to something more specific.
             *
             * For example to drop all EcalSimHits.*
             *      drop EcalSimHits.*
             *
             * or drop scoring plane collections
             *      drop .*ScoringPlane.*
             *
             * or drop scoring plane collections but keep EcalScoringPlane collection
             *      drop .*ScoringPlane.*
             *      keep EcalScoringPlane.*
             *
             * @note The Event::getImpl overrides any ignore rules for the input file in order to avoid any seg faults.
             * The items accessed will still be dropped.
             *
