   * Add a rule for dropping collections from the output.
   *
   * This needs to be called *after* setupEvent.
   * This method uses the event to help drop collections.
   *
   * The rules should be of the following form:
   *      <drop,keep, or ignore> exp
   *      where exp is an expression that matches the collectionName.
   *      ignore ==> any branch with name matching exp is not even read in from
   * the input file (if it exists) keep   ==> any branch with name matching exp
   * is read in from the input (if exists) and written to output (if exists)
   *      drop   ==> any branch with name matching exp is read in from the input
   * (if exists) and NOT written to output
   *
   * The default behavior for all branches is keep.
   *
   * ROOT uses the internal TRegexp to match branch names to the passed
   * expression and set the status of the branch (whether it will be read or
   * not). This internal object has different rules than real regular
   * expressions, so it is best to keep it safe and only use asterisks or full
   * names. Additionally, the rules you pass are analyzed in succession, so you
   * can go from something more general to something more specific.
   *
   * For example to drop all EcalSimHits.*
   *      drop EcalSimHits.*
   *
   * or drop scoring plane collections
   *      drop .*ScoringPlane.*
   *
   * or drop scoring plane collections but keep EcalScoringPlane collection
   *      drop .*ScoringPlane.*
   *      keep EcalScoringPlane.*
   *
   * @note The Event::getImpl overrides any ignore rules for the input file in
   * order to avoid any seg faults. The items accessed will still be dropped.
   *
   * @param rule The rule for dropping collections.
