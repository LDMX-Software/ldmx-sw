# HLS Algorithm Implementation

Start by making sure Vivado is sourced, if unclear run ```which vivado```.
Normally Vivado can be sourced by doing ```source /opt/Xilinx/Vivavo/2020.1/settings.sh```.
Vivado folder can vary from machine to machine.

The subdirectories here are the different subsystems with trigger algorithms implemented.
In the subsystem folder, either run ```make``` to generate the DCP IP for the HLS module or ```make gui```
to open Vivado HLS IDE for project editing.
