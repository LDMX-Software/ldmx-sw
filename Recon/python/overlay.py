"""Configuration for overlay 

Parameters
----------------
fileName : string
     The name of the file containing the pileup events to overlay on the sim event

Attributes:
-------------
passName : string
    Pass name of the sim events 
overlayPassName : string
    Pass name of the pileup events 
overlayCaloHitCollections : string
    List of SimCalorimeterHit collections to pull from the sim and pileup events and combine
overlayTrackerHitCollections : string
    List of SimTrackerHit collections to pull from the sim and pileup events and combine
totalNumberOfInteractions : int 
    The total number of interactions combined (including the sim event)
doPoisson : int
    Specifies whether to sample a Poisson(totalNumberOfInteractions) to obtain the number of events to combine (doPoisson != 0), 
    or deterministically set nOverlay=totalNumberOfInteractions-1 (doPoisson = 0)
timeSpread : float
    The width of a single bunch in time (expressed in sigma) [ns]
timeMean : float
    The average time, relative to the sim time, of the pileup events [ns]. 
    Note that this should generally be 0. A non-zero number combined with a 0 spread is useful for debugging.
nBunchesToSample : int
    The number of preceding/following bunches sampled for out-of-time pileup. 
    This is one number, assuming symmetry backwards and forwards in time. 
    Furthermore, pileup will be uniformly distributed among this number of bunches m = -N, -N+1, ..., N 
    while the sim event is always in bunch m = 0. 
bunchSpacing : float
    The spacing in time between bunches [ns]
verbosity : int
    Sets the producer specific level of verbosity, up to 3 for the most verbose step-by-step debug printouts.
